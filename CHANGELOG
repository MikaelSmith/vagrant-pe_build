-----

2013-10-14

This is a backwards incompatible bugfix and feature release.

    or symbol and the right thing will happen.

0.6.0
-----

2013-10-03

This is a backwards compatible bugfix and feature release.

### User notes:

  * The tar archive unpacker has been split into a true tar unpacker and a
    tar.gz unpacker. Archives with either '.tar' and '.tar.gz' will be
    extracted with the correct unpacker.
  * If a version of PE is requested but there's no definition for it, release
    information for the latest version of PE will be used. This means that the
    new versions of PE that aren't yet supported should work without having to
    specify an explicit answer file.
  * PE versions with trailing version information can now be used.

0.5.0
-----

2013-09-17

This is a backwards compatible bugfix and feature release.

  * Added detect_installer capability for SLES
  * (GH-32) Added detect_installer capability for Solaris
  * (GH-32) run_install capability uses posix compliant `at` command syntax
  * (GH-33) Added detect_installer and run_install capabilities for Windows

### Developer notes:

  * All StandardError exceptions emitted from transfer/open_uri are now rescued,
    so errors generated during downloads won't cause Vagrant to die with a
    stacktrace.
  * cap/detect_installer exceptions now subclass Vagrant::Errors::VagrantErrors
    so that detection errors don't cause stacktraces.
  * Archive unpacking logic has been generalized to support multiple implementations
    like 'pe_build/transfer'

Thanks to Reid Vandewiele for implementing the Windows and Solaris fixes and
extracting the 'unpack' logic.

Thanks to Charlie Sharpsteen for validating the new platform support and
correcting the issues around open_uri error handling.

    configure the Puppet master autosign.conf

#### Bugfixes

  * The pe_bootstrap provisioner restarts the pe-httpd service if changes were
    made to the master configuration that require a restart.

### Developer notes:

  * pe_bootstrap post-install configuration has been extracted out of the
    provisioner and into the PostInstall module.
  * post-install configuration is now handled by generating a Puppet manifest
    instead of executing sed and a shell script.

### Thanks

Thanks to Tom Linkin for his work on handling post-install configuration with
Augeas and Puppet.

0.3.0
-----

2013-08-14

This is a backwards compatible feature and bugfix release.

### User notes:

#### Enhancements:

  * Puppet Enterprise 3 is now fully supported and should have answers that
    work out of the box.
  * (GH-25) The installer for a given platform will be detected based on the
    guest platform, which means that the most precise installer will be used
    instead of the `all` installer.
  * pe_build.download_root now fully supports a local directory with URIs using
    the "file" URI.
  * As part of GH-25 pe_build.suffix defaults to detect, which will auto-select
    the correct installer name

#### Fixes:

  * (GH-23) Removed double expansion of files when running `vagrant pe-build copy`
  * (GH-24) Installer files are downloaded at provision time instead of before
    VMs are constructed

#### Deprecations:

  * Shell scripts run with the `add_step` hash are deprecated and will be
    removed in the next 'major development' release (either 0.4.0, 0.5.0,
    or 1.0.0). This behavior is effectively provided by the `shell` provisioner.

### Developer notes (AKA the gory details):

  * Informational logging has been expanded and is directed to the Vagrant
    internal loggers.
  * Answers file generation has been extracted out of the pe_bootstrap
    provisioner and into an independent class to respect the single
    responsibility principle.
  * New guest capability: "detect_installer" detects the correct installer
    for the given guest platform. Initial supported platforms are Debian,
    Ubuntu, and Redhat.
  * New guest capability: "run_install" extracts the actual command generation
    and execution to install PE on a guest. Initial supported platforms are
    Linux and Solaris.
  * Installer file transfer has been fully extracted from the PEBuild::Archive
    class and pushed into pe_build/transfer classes.
  * File transfer behavior has been abstracted behind the PEBuild::Transfer
    module and the implementing class is selected based on the scheme of the
    requested URI.
  * Almost everything ever has been beaten with the refactor hammer.

### Thanks

  * Thanks to Tom Linkin as always for his awesome work and contributions to
    this plugin.
  * Thanks to Jon Mosco for reporting GH-23.
